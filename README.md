Tasks: 

1) Create a web page with a text box and a button. When the button is clicked, save the user's input to sessionStorage. Add another button that, when clicked, will display the saved data on the web page.

2) Modify our ToDo list. Store the list in localStorage so tasks remain available after page reload.

3) Create a simple form with a few settings (eg page background color) and store the user's choices in localStorage. The next time you open the page, apply these settings. A more difficult option is to modify your theme editor with css changes

4) Create a mathOperations.js file that declares functions for basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Export these functions using named export. Create an index.js file where you import and use these functions to perform math operations.


5) Create a stringUtilities.js file that contains functions for working with strings, for example, a function to convert a string to uppercase and a function to wrap a string. Export these functions. In index.js, import and use these functions.


Practic in using export and import, working with LocalStorage and SessionStorage.
No issue during the working on code.
